# gender-gap-visualization

Hello! Welcome!

Here, you'll find a quick data visualization exercise to demostrate how to take an initial set of graphs/plots and strip away excess features to tell a story concisely

The exercise was part of a dataquest.io lesson, however, the data was not provided by dataquest.
